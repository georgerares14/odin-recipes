    <h1>Carbonara</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        The better the ingredients the better the meal, and that’s certainly true for any carbonara. But even if you break the rules and make it with what you have on hand like I just did—using supermarket pasta, bacon, and grated parmesan cheese—it’s going to be pretty damn good. 
    </p>
    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 egg yolk</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves </li>
        <li>2 tbsp Parmigiano</li>
        <li>2 tsp butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            With a fork, beat the egg yolk in a shallow soup/pasta bowl. Whisk in the parsley and half of the Parmigiano-Reggiano.
        </li>
        <li>
            When the pasta is al dente, drain and immediately turn it into the bowl with the egg mixture, lifting and turning the strands with a fork until coated. Mix in the shallot-pancetta mixture, and sprinkle with the remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano.   
        </li>
    </ol>
